CMake is re-running because C:/Users/4RCHURA/Desktop/Archura_game_engine/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
  the file 'C:/Users/4RCHURA/Desktop/Archura_game_engine/CMakeLists.txt'
  is newer than 'C:/Users/4RCHURA/Desktop/Archura_game_engine/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
  result='-1'
CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0091 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
